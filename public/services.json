        "description": "A cataract is a clouding of the natural lens in the eye that affects vision.The lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light, or an image, on the retina. The retina is the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In a normal eye, light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. Once it reaches the retina, light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain.",
